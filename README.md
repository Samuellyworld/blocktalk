## 🤦🏼‍♂️ Problem
We are all overwhelmed by a constant influx of spam emails, messages, and advertisements across various platforms, yet we receive no tangible reward for the attention we expend sifting through this noise. Despite the inherent value of our time and focus, we are left uncompensated while corporations and spammers exploit their inboxes. This imbalance creates a frustrating experience for users, who lack control over who can reach them and are unable to monetize their attention, while legitimate advertisers and professionals struggle to connect with high-value individuals amidst the clutter.

## ✅ Solution

Block Talk is a decentralized messaging app built on the Bitcoin network that empowers users to take control of their communication by monetizing their attention. With Block Talk, users create accounts and set customizable price targets in satoshis (sats) for incoming messages based on perceived importance, ensuring that only senders willing to pay can reach them. This system filters out spam, rewards users for their time with Bitcoin payments, and provides a secure, privacy-focused platform that leverages blockchain technology to eliminate intermediaries and enhance user autonomy.

Block Talk presents a unique opportunity to revolutionize digital communication by aligning economic incentives with user attention, tapping into the growing Bitcoin ecosystem and the increasing demand for privacy-centric solutions.

By bridging the gap between attention economics and decentralized technology, Block Talk has the potential to capture a significant share of the messaging and advertising market, offering a win-win for users and senders alike.
