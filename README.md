## Problem
Spam is a lose-lose mess. Users drown in junk—90% of emails are spam—wasting time with no reward. Corporations lose too, blindly blasting messages that miss the mark instead of hitting the right audience. We’re flipping it: Block Talk turns attention into a win-win, where users earn for their focus and companies get more bang for their buck targeting the right people.

Block Talk is a decentralized messaging app built on the Bitcoin network that empowers users to take control of their communication by monetizing their attention. With Block Talk, users create accounts and set customizable price targets in satoshis (sats) for incoming messages based on perceived importance, ensuring that only senders willing to pay can reach them. This system filters out spam, rewards users for their time with Bitcoin payments, and provides a secure, privacy-focused platform that leverages blockchain technology to eliminate intermediaries and enhance user autonomy.

## Opportunity

Block Talk presents a unique opportunity to revolutionize digital communication by aligning economic incentives with user attention, tapping into the growing Bitcoin ecosystem and the increasing demand for privacy-centric solutions. As cryptocurrency adoption rises, millions of Bitcoin users could turn to Block Talk to earn income from their inboxes, while advertisers, sales professionals, and business development leaders gain a direct, efficient channel to reach targeted, high-value individuals. By bridging the gap between attention economics and decentralized technology, Block Talk has the potential to capture a significant share of the messaging and advertising market, offering a win-win for users and senders alike.
